                        <p>Book Bargains is a final group project I helped create for a software engineering course. 
                            The business scenario we were presented with was to design a platform for college students 
                            seeking to buy/sell books with ease once they were done with a course. The result was a website,
                            which allowed for easy listing as well as efficient searching with a variety filters. The project was 
                            created using a Django framework with Python code, as well as HTML and CSS for the front end.

                            An online shopping simulator is a project I tackled for two different classes through two very 
                            different coding lenses. For my object oriented design course, I created a online shopping simulated 
                            experience that broke various behind the scenes components into modular objects. "Clothes" in the store 
                            were created using factory methods and added to a "cart" which was modeled using the decorator pattern. 
                            All code for this project was done in Java. For a database systems and applications course, our final 
                            group project was to design the SQL database behind an online shopping website. SQL tables were created to 
                            represent customers, products, and orders, while a shopper front-end was created in the Oracle App Developer
                            Environment.

                        <p>Exploring Links Between Economic Status and Crime was a research paper I co-wrote my junior year for an 
                            economic statistics course. This paper was my first dive in to statistics and data analytics. The data examined
                            is from a dataset on prison populations and crime rates available through Boston College. In our effort to examine
                            if economic status is truly inversely related to crime, our statistical and graphical models informed us that the 
                            percent concentration of a population in metro areas and unemployment rates are the two most useful statistics to 
                            predict crime rates, while income may actually be an ineffective predictor. All data analysis was done using Stata.

                        <p>Intelligence vs Intimacy was a research paper I co-wrote my senior year for an econometrics course. With a much wider selection
                            of datasets to tackle and questions to answer, my group wondered if one's level of education affects their likelihood to be 
                            married and the success of one's marriages. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, we learned that an increase in 
                            education is linked with a higher likelihood to be married for women, while men only receive a boost to marriage likelihood once 
                            they receive a college degree. Higher levels of education are also loosely linked to fewer marriages per person, indicating 
                            higher quality marriages less like to end in divorce. All data analysis was done using Stata.

                        <img className="image" id="experimentdesignimage" src="../images/expdesign.png" alt="experimental design"></img>
                        <p>Will a Future Wage Increase Help Workers Now? is a final group project I completed for an experimental economics course. When 
                            tasked with designing an experiment to answer any question, my partner and I were curious in the effects of minimum wage. 
                            While research has been done on the effects of minimum wage and how an increase in money can lead to more security and better
                            mental health for workers, very little research has been done into the effects of the wage announcement itself. Our experiment
                            was designed to determine the cognition of a worker and willingness to work and isolate how these may changed based on the 
                            announcement of an increase in wages.
