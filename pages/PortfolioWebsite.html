            <p className="center">This website was my first endeavor into web development. Prior to making it, I only had limited experience
            using HTML and CSS, so I wanted to take the opportunity to improve my web development skills. Before designing the website, I did 
            a deep dive into learning HTML and CSS and learned the JavaScript and React.js necessary to create a web app using react.</p>
