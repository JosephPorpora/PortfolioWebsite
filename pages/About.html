            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;My name is Joseph Porpora and I am a recent graduate of Boston College. I majored in Computer Science and Economics, and 
                this website is to showcase some of my projects in the fields of software engineering and data analysis (as well as being one itself!). 
            </p>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;I am a dedicated and incredibly self-motivated worker and have completed many projects for both my undergraduate classes
                and in my personal endeavors to learn new skills. I've learned a host of coding languages to do everything from front-end design to 
                database creation to economic research and can pick up new skills incredibly fast due to my technical background. I will continue
                to update this website with the projects and skills I learn in my efforts to grow academically.
            </p>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;I am currently looking to start a career in the field of software engineering or data analysis. Ever since my first research project 
                (Economic Status vs Crime in the NavBar!), I have really enjoyed diving into complex datasets and finding interesting narratives within 
                the data. Last Summer I interned for <i>Boston Road Runners</i>, a running non-profit which seeks to foster an inclusive running community
                in the Boston area. As a data analytics intern, I gained first hand experience cleansing and analyzing client data in Excel, organizing reports 
                for donors and sponsors, and optimizing future data-collection through more uniform entry methods. The ability to make data-informed 
                decisions to make positive change in my internship was an incredible experience.
            </p>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp; Recently, my inspiration to learn more in the field of data analytics has come from two different books. <i>Freakonomics</i>, 
                by Levitt and Dubner, provides many case studies on unorthodox ways
                in which data was used to solve problems, like unearthing a massive cheating scandal in the Japanese sumo wrestling community. <i>The xG Philosophy</i>,
                by James Tippett, discusses how new methods for recording and using statistics in soccer have revolutionized how some teams scout players
                and how gamblers have made millions upon millions on the sport in recent years. Brentford FC, a team recently promoted to the English 
                Premier League, are the soccer equivalent of the "Moneyball" Oakland A's, and are a must watch as this data revolution in soccer plays 
                out in real time.
