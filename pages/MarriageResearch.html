            <h1 class="center">Intelligence vs Intimacy: An Examination of Higher Education and Marital Outcomes</h1>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;<i>Intelligence vs Intimacy</i> was a research paper I co-wrote my senior year for my Econometrics course. With a wide selection
                of datasets to use and questions to answer, my group decided to examine the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). 
                After inspecting the nature of the data collected, especially the variables pertaining to marriage and education,
                we wondered if one's level of education affects their likelihood to be married, as well as the success of one's marriage. 
            </p>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;Using the NSFG, we learned that an increase in education is linked with a higher likelihood to be married for women, 
                while men only receive a boost to marriage likelihood once they receive a college degree. Higher levels of education are also 
                loosely linked to fewer marriages per person, indicating higher quality marriages less likely to end in divorce. All data analysis 
                for this project was done using Stata.
