            <h1 class="center">Will a Future Wage Increase Help Workers Now?</h1>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;<i>Will a Future Wage Increase Help Workers Now?</i>&nbsp; is a final group project I completed for an Experimental Economics course. When 
                tasked with designing an experiment to answer any question, my partner and I were curious to examine the psychological effects of wage 
                changes. While plenty of research has been done on the effects of minimum wage and how an increase in money can lead to more security and better
                mental health for workers, very little research has been done into the effects of the wage announcement itself. Our experiment
                was designed to determine a worker's cognition and willingness to work and isolate how these may change based on the 
                announcement of an increase in wages.
            </p>
            <p class="left description">
                &emsp;&emsp;Our experiment requires subjects to partake in a monotonous task which resembled work for a series of rounds. Our treatment group
                would then be informed their reward would increase in future rounds, while the control group would not be informed of any reward increases. By
                telling this information only to the treatment group while still not raising the reward, we hoped to isolate the effects of the announcement
                itself and not the money associated with it. Though we were not required to implement this experiment within the scope of the class, we do 
                believe there could be fascinating answers to our research question. While money is obviously the concrete reward of a job that can 
                directly change one's living situation, the psychological benefits of expecting more money could be incredibly strong, leading to a higher
                standard of worker well-being and a more stable labor market.
